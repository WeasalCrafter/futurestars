Step 1: go ahead to www.aternos.org and create a free account, this website is free due to 
constant ads being presented; however it is HIGHLY reccomended, but not neccesary, to purchase 
a dedicated server from a service like https://apexminecrafthosting.com.

Step 2: You should be prompted with a screen with a button, "Create Server", click this, and 
you will be prompted with another screen confirming the creation, click "create", to continue.

Step 3: At this point you should be at the panel of your server, on the left side of your 
screen there will be multiple buttons/tabs, click into the "Software" tab. There will be
multiple options for software, select "Paper/Bukkit", then select the latest version of 
minecraft(at the time of writing this 1.20.1), then click the green "Install" button.

Step 4: On the left side of your screen there will be multiple buttons/tabs, click into 
the "Plugins" tab, this is where you will install all of your plugins/add-ons for the 
server. There is a search bar where you will search for plugins: 

 . First, search "ChatFilter" and install "ChatFilter - Chat, Signs, Books and Anvils"
 . Second, search "Clearlagg" and install "Clearlagg"
 . Third, search "Coreprotect" and install "Coreprotect"
 . Fourth, search "SimpleTpa" and install "Simple Tpa"
 . Fifth, search "WorldEdit" and install "WorldEdit for bukkit"
 . Last, search "Worldguard" and install "Worldguard"

Step 5: Go back to the main server panel and click the green "Start" button to boot your 
server. You should log onto the server using the provided ip address found on the server 
panel. Once in the server, from the console, run the command "op {username here}", so for 
a username of weasalcrafter the command would be "op weasalcrafter". This command gives 
administrator privelidges to the user and allows for further configuration within the server 
itself.
